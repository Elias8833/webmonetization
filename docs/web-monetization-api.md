The Web Monetization API provides a seemless payment experience for site owners and site visitors. Unlike the W3C's Payment Request API, when a web-monetized visitor visits a web-monetized website, a continuous stream of micro-payments takes place automatically. Thus, visitors automatically send a small sum per time unit to any web-monetized website they visit. The rate of payment is predetermined by the user's web monetization agent and adapts over time.
