To add web monetization to your page, you will need to add a `<link>` tag with a rel='monetization' indicating that some content on the page is monetized.  While a HTML document can contain an unlimited number of monetized `<link>` tags, implementations may restrict how many of those links are actually monetized. 

## Examples

### Monetization load events

## Specifications

<Specifications link="link-type-monetization">Web Monetization API</Specifications>

## Browser compatibility

rel.monetization
