          This specification is a work in progress within the community on the
          best shape it should take. Please see the <a href=

          The specification reflects the desired end-state of the Web
          Monetization APIs as currently anticipated and agreed to between the
          contributors. The specification is being prepared here, in this
          format, to collect the input of the Web community and prepare the
          work to ultimately follow the W3C standards track should it have the
          necessary support to do so.

      <h2>
        Security considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        It is RECOMMENDED that a user agent provide some UI or indicator that
        allows the user to know when [=monetization=] is possible and/or when
        [=monetization=] is occurring. Providing such a UI allows the users to
        retain control of the monetization process by taking action (e.g., stop
        or start monetization of a particular site if they wish to do so).
      </p>
      <p>
        As [=payment end-points=] are generally provided as a service (e.g.,
        Uphold), a XSS attack could inject a malicious [=payment end-points=]
        into a page that uses the same service. To mitigate such an attack, it
        RECOMMENDED that developers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>host a [=payment end-point=] on their own servers and request
        [[SPSP]] details from the provider on the server as needed.
        </li>
        <li>Set the `monetization-src` CSP directive to restrict requests to
        origins they control and trust to host [=payment end-points=].
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>
        Privacy considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Web monetization is designed to be privacy-preserving: The user agent
        does not send any data to the [=monetization provider=]. Instead, it
        requests data from the [=monetization provider=] without ever revealing
        the URL of the web page the user is currently browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, the user agent gets the payment information from the [=payment
        end-point=] to establish the [[STREAM]] connection. This also ensures
        the [=monetization provider=] doesn't have access to a user's browsing
        history or to the [=payment end-point=].

      <h2>
        Relation to Web Payments
      </h2>
      <p>
        Unlike [[[Payment-Request]]] and the [[[Payment-Handler]]], Web
        Monetization is intended for continuous payments rather than discrete
        payments. Additionally, it is designed to <em>not</em> require any user
        interaction, serving as an alternative to traditional e-commerce
        checkout methods.
